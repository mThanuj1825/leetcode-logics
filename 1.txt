-> Find the pair of numbers that sum up to target
-> We can use a HashMap to store the differences of current element and the target sum and then find the pair in each iteration
-> The Solution:
	-> Create an empty map
	-> Loop through the array
	-> If the current value is present in the map, return the current index and the value in map
	-> Else we add the element in map as {target - current, index of current}
