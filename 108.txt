-> We need to convert the given sorted array of integers to a binary search tree
-> We can do this using a simple binary search like approach
-> The Solution:
	-> If the recursive subarray is of length 0, we return null
	-> First find the mid point of the array
	-> Create a node with that mid element from the array
	-> Then for the children of this node
		-> For left child, call the same function recursively for subarray from least to mid - 1		-> For right child, call the same function recursively for subarray from mid + 1 to end
	-> Finally, we return node
