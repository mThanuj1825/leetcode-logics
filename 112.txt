-> Given a binary tree, we need to find if a path exists for the targetSum
-> We can do this recursively using backtracking
-> The Solution:
	-> If the given root is null, we return False
	-> If it is the leaf node and the targetSum equals the node value, we return True
	-> We recursively calculate the left and right validations
	-> Finally we return left or right, showing us that atleast one path on the left or right leads to the targetSum
