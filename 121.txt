-> We need to choose a minimum day to buy such that the next maximum buy day will give us the maximum profits
-> We can use linear search to do this
-> The Solution:
	-> set max to 0 and minPrice to 0th Day
	-> for every price in the array
		-> if price is less than minPrice, update minPrice
		-> else, calculate profit and update max
	-> return max
