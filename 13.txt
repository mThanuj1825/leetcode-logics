-> We need to convert the roman to integer
-> We can do this using maps
-> The Solution:
	-> First create a map for all the values
	-> Then iterate the string from the end
	-> If the current symbol's value is less than the previous symbol's value, then subtract the current value from the total sum
	-> Else add the current value to the sum
	-> Finally return n
