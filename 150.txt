-> We need to process a Reverse Polish Notation or postfix notation and return the resultant value
-> We can solve this using a stack
-> The Solution:
	-> Create an empty stack
	-> Iterate through all the tokens
		-> If the token is not a mathematical symbol, append it into stack
		-> Else, pop 2 elments from the stack and perform that operation between them and then append the resultant value into the stack
	-> Pop and return the alst value from the stack
