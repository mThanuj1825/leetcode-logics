-> We need to implement a min stack that has O(1) time complexity for retrieving the min element
-> The Solution:
	-> init()
		-> Initialize min to least integer
		-> Initialize empty stack
	-> push()
		-> Modify the min value based on input value
		-> Push into the stack
	-> pop()
		-> If we have no elements in the stack, pop the value from stack and modify the min element
	-> top()
		-> Return last element in stack
	-> getMin()
		-> Return min element
