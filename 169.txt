-> We need to find the majority element in the given array of integers
-> We can do this using Boyer-Moore voting algorithm
-> The Solution:
	-> First initialize count and majority to 0
	-> Iterate over all the integers in the array
		-> If the count is 0, we update the majority as current element and then make count as 1
		-> If majority is equal to the current element, we increment count
		-> Else we decrement count
	-> Return majority
