-> We need to reverse the bits of a current 32-bit integer and return the new integer
-> We can do this using Bit Manipulation
-> The Solution:
	-> We initialize res to 0
	-> We perform a loop for 32 times
		-> Each time we left shift res by 1 and bitwise-or it with (n & 1)
		-> We right shift n by 1
	-> In the end we return the new integer res
