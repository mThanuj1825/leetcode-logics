-> We need to find whether the string has valid paranthesis or not
-> We can do this using a stack
-> The Solution:
	-> For every opening bracket we encounter, we push it into stack
		-> If the first bracket we encounter is a closing, we return False
	-> For every closing bracket we encounter, we pop one element from stack and check for compatability of popped bracket and the current bracket
		-> If not compaible we return False
