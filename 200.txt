-> We need to find the no of islands that are present in the given sea
-> We can use a depth first search
-> The Solution:
	-> First iterate through all row and col indices using a nested loop
	-> For every row, col check if the value is '1'
		-> If so, increment count and call dfs on that row and col
			-> In the dfs, 
				-> Check for constraints along with if the current val is '0' we return
				-> Else, we modify the current val to '0'
				-> Call the same dfs on all directions of the current value
	-> Return count
