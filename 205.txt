-> Check whether the given strings are isomorphic or not
-> We can do this using string manipulation
-> The Solution:
	-> create 2 maps, one for s to t and other for t to s
	-> iterate through s and update the map for every alphabet in s to t
		-> If the current alphabet is already in map and it doesnt map to the correct alphabet, return False
	-> iterate through t and update the map for every alphabet in t to s
		-> If the current alphabet is already in map and it doesnt map to the correct alphabet, return False
	-> return True
