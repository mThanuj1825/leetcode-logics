-> We need to merge two sorted LinkedLists
-> We can do this easily as the elements as sorted, we can compare the values in both lists and add them to result ListNode
-> The Solution:
	-> Loop through the both lists until the both nodes are not null
	-> Compare the elements of first and second
		-> If first is less than second, insert first and move first
		-> Else insert second and move second
	-> After the loop if there are any remaining elements in either first or second, add them all to the result
