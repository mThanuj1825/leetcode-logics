-> We need to check if there are any two distinct indices whose values are equal and the difference between the indices is less than or equal to k
-> We can solve this using a hashmap
-> The Solution:
	-> Create an empty map
	-> For every integer in the nums,
		-> If the integer is already in map, and if the difference of indices is less than or equal to k, return true
		-> Put 'integer' as key and its index as value in the map
	-> Return false
