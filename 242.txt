-> T is an anagram of S if we can create T with all the characters of S
	-> "anagram" and "nagaram"
-> We can use HashMap to count the frequencies of characters in both the strings
-> The Solution:
	-> Loop through T and create frequency map
	-> Loop through S and create frequency map
	-> Compare the frequencies and return true if they are same 
	-> Else return false
