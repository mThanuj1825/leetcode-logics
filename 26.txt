-> We need remove duplicates in a sorted array and then return the size of unique elements
-> We can do this using a two pointer approach
-> The Solution:
	-> Initialize left to 0
	-> Iterate through the indices of nums using right
	-> If the left number and right number are not equal we increment left and swap left and right
	-> In the end we return left + 1
