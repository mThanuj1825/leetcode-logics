-> We need to find out whether a number is ugly or not
-> We can do this using brute force
-> The Solution
	-> First check if the number is 0, we return False
	-> Then we remove all the 2's from the factors
	-> Then we remove all the 3's from the factors
	-> Then we remove all the 5's from the factors
	-> If the number is changed to 1, we return True, else False
