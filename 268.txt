-> We need to find the missing number from array having [0, n]
-> We can do this using a formula of sum of n natural numbers
-> The Solution:
	-> First we find out the value of n by the length of array
	-> Then we calculate the formula based sum (n * (n + 1)) / 2
	-> Then we calculate the actual sum from the array by adding all the elements together
	-> Then return formula sum - actual sum
