-> We need remove element in a array and then return the size of other elements
-> We can do this using a two pointer approach
-> The Solution:
	-> Initialize left to 0
	-> Iterate through the indices of nums using right
	-> If the right number is not equal to val we change left value to right value and increment left
	-> In the end we return left
