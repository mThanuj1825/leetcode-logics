-> We need to find the index of first occcurance of needle in haystack
-> We can do this by bruteforce
-> The Solution:
	-> First check if haystack starts with needle, if so return 0
	-> Check if haystack ends with needle, if so return len(haystack) - len(needle)
	-> Now loop through all indices of haystack
		-> If the current character in haystack does not equals the first character of needle, we skip
		-> Else we check if we still have enough space for the needle to fit in the haystack, if not we break and return -1
		-> We need to check for the entire needle from the stopped index in haystack
		-> For this, we can use a For-Else loop and return i in else condition
