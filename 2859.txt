-> Given an array of integers and a integer k, find sum of all integers whose indices' bit count is equal to k
-> We can do this using bit manipulation
-> The Solution:
    -> First initialize sum to 0
    -> Then iterate through all the indices
        -> For every index, check the no of set bits in it
        -> If no of set bits is equal to k, add it to sum
    -> Return sum
