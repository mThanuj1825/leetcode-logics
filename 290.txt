-> We need to check if the mapping from the pattern is there for every word in s
-> We can do this using a simple hash map
-> The Solution:
	-> Create an empty map
	-> Split s into a string array
	-> If the length of pattern is not equal to length of strings, return false
	-> Iterate over all the characters in pattern and its respective string in strings array
		-> If character is already in map and its value is not equal to current string, we return false
		-> Else, If the string is not present in the value set, we add the entry of the current character and its string
		-> Else we return false
	-> Return true
