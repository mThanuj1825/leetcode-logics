-> We need to find the longest substring in the string that doesnt have any repeating characters
-> We can use Sliding Window to solve this
-> The Solution:
	-> First we create a set to store the characters encountered
	-> We initialize left to 0
	-> We then loop from 0 to len(string)
	-> For every character that we encounter in string that is also a part of the set, we remove it and increment left pointer by 1
	-> Else we add the current character to the set and modify the max value of the result and increment the right pointer by 1
	-> We then find out the new size of the set and then update the result variable
