-> We need to count the number of set bits present from 0 <= i <= n, and add them in a list and return the list
-> We can do this using a simple loop
-> The Solution:
	-> Create an empty list
	-> Loop from [0, n]
	-> For every i value, count the number of set bits and then append it to the list
	-> return the list
