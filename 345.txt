-> We need to reverse only the vowels in a given string
-> We can do this using two pointer approach
-> The Solution:
	-> Initialzie l = 0 and r = len(s) - 1
	-> Loop while l < r
		-> In order to find the first vowel, we need to loop until the lth character is vowel and increment l
		-> In order to find the last vowel, we need to loop until the rth character is vowel and decrement r
		-> Then swap lth and rth element
		-> Then increment l and decrement r
	-> return the resultant string
