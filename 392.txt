-> We need to check if s is a sub sequence of t
-> We can do this using a 2 pointer approach
-> The Solution:
	-> Initialize l, r to 0
	-> While l is less than length of s,
		-> Put r in its respective position such that t[r] == s[l] by using a while loop
		-> Check if r == len(t), if so return False
		-> Increment l, r
	-> return True
