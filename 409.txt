-> We need to find the length of the longest palindrome that can be made using the characters of the string str
-> We can use sets in order to find out this
-> The Solution:
	-> Create an empty set s
	-> For every char in str, 
		-> If char not in s, add it to s
		-> Else, remove it from s
	-> If length of s is 0, return length of str
	-> Else, return difference between length of s and str + 1
