-> We need to find the third unique max number in an array, if the length of array is less than 4, find max
-> We can do this using a set
-> The Solution:
	-> First convert the list to set
	-> Then sort the set into a list in reverse order
	-> If length of nums is less than 4, we return nums[0]
	-> Else, we return nums[2]
