-> We need to add 2 numbers that are given as strings
-> The Solution:
	-> Modify the num1 and num2 based on the size of the strings
	-> For the smaller number pad it with zeroes to equalize the sizes
	-> Initialize res to empty and carry to 0
	-> Loop in a reverse order:
		-> for every loop, find the sum = num1[i] + num2[i] + carry
		-> Modify carry based on the sum value
		-> Insert the required amount of sum in the beginning of res
	-> If there is a carry, insert it into the beginning of res
	-> Return res
