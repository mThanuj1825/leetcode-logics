-> We need to sort the string based on their frequencies
-> We can do this using a map or a frequency array
-> The Solution:
	-> First create a 2d array of size 256x2
	-> Iterate through each character in the string
		-> Mark the 0th position of the current character's ascii valued position in the 2d array as the currrent character ascii value
	-> For every character in the string, increment its frequency in the array
	-> Sort the array based on the 1st index of each element (meaning frequencies)
	-> Create a new string and use the counting sort logic to add the amount of characters into the new string
	-> Return the new string
