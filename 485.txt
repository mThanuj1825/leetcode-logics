-> We need to find the maximum no of consecutive ones in a list
-> We can do this using a simple loop
-> The Solution:
    -> We need to initialize maximum and current to 0
    -> Then iterate through all the numbers in nums array
    -> If the number is equal to 0, we need to update the maximum and then change current to 0
    -> Else, we need to increment current
    -> At the end of the loop, we need to consider an edge case of ending with 1, so we also update maximum for one more time
    -> Return maximum
