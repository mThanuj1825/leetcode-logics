-> We need to find the length of the last word in a string
-> We can do this using a linear search
-> The Solution:
	-> First we need to strip the extra spaces
	-> Then we iterate in a reverse order
	-> If we find a space somewhere, we return len(s) - i - 1
	-> If we did not find any spaces we return the len(s) as there is only one word
