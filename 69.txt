-> We need to find the square root of a number, but only upto the integer value
-> We can do this using Newton-Raphson method
-> The Solution:
	-> We initialize guess to be x // 2 if x > 1 else 1
	-> We do a loop while guess * guess > x
		-> Formula is, guess = (guess + x // guess) // 2
	-> After the loop we return guess
