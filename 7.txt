-> We have to reverse a given integer
-> If it is -ve, we should return -ve only
-> We have to also assume that it is 32-bit integer and not 64-bit
-> The Solution:
	-> First store the absolute value of x in t
	-> Then reverse the t using string
	-> If the t exceeds the boundaries of 32-bit integer, return 0
	-> Else return -t or +t based on the x's sign
