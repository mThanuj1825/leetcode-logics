-> Given l, r, we need to find out all the self dividing numbers between l and r
-> The Solution:
    -> Loop from l to r
    -> For every num value, check if it is self dividing
        -> If the number contains 0 or any digit does not divide it, dont add it to result list
        -> Else add it to the result list
    -> Return result
