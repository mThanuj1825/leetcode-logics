-> We are given an array of temperatures of each day of n days
-> For every day, we need to find the next warmer day, if there is no warmer day, we put it as 0
-> We can do this using a Monotonic Stack
-> The Solution:
	-> Create a result array and a stack
	-> For every index in temperatures,
		-> While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the top,
			-> Pop and at that index, put i - j
		-> Push the current index into the stack
	-> Return result
