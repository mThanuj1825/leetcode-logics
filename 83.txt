-> Given a linked list of integers in a sorted order, we need to remove the duplicate elements
-> We can do this using a simple loop
-> The Solution:
	-> If the head is null, return head
	-> Else initialize t to head
	-> Loop through the linked list until t.next is null
		-> If current value is equal to next value, make the current next to next's next
		-> Else, increment t to next
	-> Return head
