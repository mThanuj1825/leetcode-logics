-> We are given two sorted arrays, and we need to merge the second array into the first one in the sorted order
-> We can use two pointer approach to solve this
-> The Solution:
	-> Initialize l to m - 1 and r to n - 1
	-> Initialize idx to m + n - 1
	-> While l is valid and r is valid
		-> Check for which element to be placed in idx position of nums1
		-> Based on that decrement the respective indices
	-> While l is valid
		-> Add the integer to idx index
	-> While r is valid
		-> Add the integer to idx index
